Quickfix window pops up on gr (vim.lsp.buf.references()). Would be nice to auto move cursor to it,
And after you press enter on a line, it jumps the cursor to the new window, so you have to manually jump back.
Would be nice for the cursor to stay there. Preview window? Or something like FZF's preview would be great.

--Try a minimal config and see if it works
--Might be ccls, try cquery or clangd or ..?
--try to find a log that shows a crash. ccls log? lsp.log?
